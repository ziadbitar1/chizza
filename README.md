# Importing an external Git repository using the command line

If your source code is tracked in a Git repository, you can import the repository using Git on the command line.

Before you start, make sure you know:

* Your GitHub username
* The clone URL for the external repository, such as `https://external-host.com/user/repo.git` or `git://external-host.com/user/repo.git` (perhaps with a `user@` in front of the `external-host.com` domain name)

> \[!NOTE]
> For purposes of demonstration, we'll use:
>
> * An external account named **extuser**
> * An external Git host named `https://external-host.com`
> * A GitHub personal account named **ghuser**
> * A repository on GitHub.com named **repo.git**

1. [Create a new repository on GitHub](/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). You'll import your external Git repository to this new repository.

2. On the command line, make a "bare" clone of the external repository using the external clone URL. This creates a full copy of the data, but without a working directory for editing files, and ensures a clean, fresh export of all the old data.

   ```shell
   $ git clone --bare https://external-host.com/EXTUSER/REPO.git
   # Makes a bare clone of the external repository in a local directory
   ```

3. Push the locally cloned repository to GitHub using the "mirror" option, which ensures that all references, such as branches and tags, are copied to the imported repository.

   ```shell
   $ cd REPO.git
   $ git push --mirror https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
   # Pushes the mirror to the new repository on GitHub.com
   ```

4. Remove the temporary local repository.

   ```shell
   cd ..
   rm -rf REPO.git
   ```

If the repository you are importing contains large files, you may run into a warning or error. For more information on large files and how to manage them, see [About large files on GitHub](/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github).
